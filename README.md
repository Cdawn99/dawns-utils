# Dawn's utils

A collection of useful utilities I've found myself writing over and over again.

This is a single header library. For the implementation, you need to `#define DAWN_IMPLEMENTATION` in one of your C source files.

Inspired by [Alexey Kutepov's](https://github.com/rexim) `nob.h`, which he uses accross multiple of his projects.

Untested on Windows.
